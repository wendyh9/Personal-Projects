## Purpose and Learned Concepts
This project allowed me to test my understanding of computer organization through the use of assembly. I was able to develop a clear sense of memory management and how values are assigned to certain registers by using MARS MIPS.

## Procedures of the Program
<ol>
    <li>The program prompts the user to input any amount of numbers (an array of numbers).</li>
    <li>Then, the program will proceed to organize the array of numbers in descending order.</li>
    <li>Afterwards, the user will be asked to input the amount of numbers to remove from array. This will remove the smallest numbers.</li>
    <li>Lastly, the program will calculate the average (rounded down) of the remaining numbers in the array.</li>
