## Purpose and Learned Concepts
This project allowed me to test my understanding of computer organization through the use of C. I was able to practice working with pointers and matrices as well as challenge myself to use recursion in order to complete this project.

## Procedures of the Program
<ol>
    <li>When compiling using the executable, the user will identify which puzzle they'd like to search a word in.</li>
    <li>Then, the program prompts the user to input a word they'd like to be found in their chosen puzzle.</li>
    <li>The program will print out the chosen puzzle.</li>
    <li>Afterwards, the user will be notified whether their word has been found.</li>
    <li>Lastly, the program will print out the puzzle replaced with numbers indicating the search path in which the letters of the word were found. (0 means the letter in that location does not belong to the word while any number larger than 0 indicate the search path and the order in which the letter is in the word.)
        <ul>
           <li>Note: there may be multiple search paths for a word and the program takes this into consideration and will print out the different search paths in this step</li> 
        </ul>
    </li>
